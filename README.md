## Answer for Step 4 also seen here: 

**Question:** How well does the logistic regression model predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?

**Answer:** The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model in predicting loan statuses, specifically distinguishing between healthy loans (0) and high-risk loans (1). The goal is to determine how well the model can predict these labels, thereby assisting the company in making informed decisions about loan risk management.

**Results**
* Accuracy Score: The model achieved an overall accuracy of 99%.
* Precision Score:
    * Healthy loans (0): 1.00
    * High-risk loans (1): 0.86
* Recall Score:
    * Healthy loans (0): 0.99
    * High-risk loans (1): 0.94

**Summary:**
The logistic regression model demonstrates excellent performance in predicting loan statuses. It achieves near-perfect precision and recall for healthy loans, ensuring that almost all loans identified as healthy are indeed healthy. For high-risk loans, the model maintains strong precision and very high recall, indicating its effectiveness in correctly identifying the majority of high-risk loans.

**Recommendation:**
Given its high accuracy, precision and recall scores, I recommend using this model for loan risk assessment. It provides a reliable method for identifying high-risk loans, which will significantly aid the company's strategy.
